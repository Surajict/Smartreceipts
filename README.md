## 🌟 What This App Does (For Non-Technical Users)

**Think of Smart Receipts as your personal receipt assistant that:**
- Takes a photo of any receipt and instantly understands what you bought
- Remembers when your warranties expire and reminds you before they do
- Organizes all your purchases in one easy-to-find place
- Works on any device with a camera and internet connection
- **NEW**: Handles multi-product receipts (like shopping at electronics stores with multiple items)
- **NEW**: Tracks warranty periods for each individual product separately
- **NEW**: Uses AI to validate and correct receipt data automatically
- **NEW**: Includes admin tools for managing subscription codes and user access

**Example:** You buy a laptop ($1,299, 3-year warranty), a mouse ($29, 1-year warranty), and a keyboard ($79, 2-year warranty) from Best Buy. Smart Receipts automatically knows these are three separate products with different warranty periods and will remind you about each one individually!

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Admin Portal Configuration**

The Admin Portal requires specific database setup and functions:

#### **Database Functions Required:**
- `get_admin_subscription_stats()` - Returns real-time statistics
- `create_subscription_code(duration_months, notes)` - Generates new codes

#### **Database Tables:**
- `admin_settings` - Stores configuration like subscription system type
- `subscription_codes` - Stores generated subscription codes
- `user_subscriptions` - Links users to their subscriptions

#### **Row Level Security (RLS):**
The Admin Portal handles RLS restrictions gracefully:
- Uses database functions that bypass RLS policies
- Falls back to local storage for settings when database access is restricted
- Maintains functionality even with limited database permissions

### **MCP Server Setup (Cursor IDE Users)**

- **Notifications** - User notifications tables and helpers (NEW!)

To apply migrations:
```bash
supabase db push
```

## 🧠 Smart Search & AI Features Setup

### **Vector Search Setup**
1. **Enable pgvector extension** in your Supabase project
2. **Run the vector search migration** to create embedding columns
3. **Deploy the smart-search edge function** for AI-powered search
4. **Generate embeddings** for existing receipts

### **Edge Functions**
Deploy Edge Functions:
```bash
# Core smart search
supabase functions deploy smart-search

# Embedding helpers
supabase functions deploy generate-embedding
supabase functions deploy backfill-embeddings

# Push notifications
supabase functions deploy send-push-notification
```

### **Embedding Generation**
The app automatically generates embeddings for new receipts. For existing receipts:
1. Go to the Dashboard
2. Look for the "Index Receipts" button
3. Click to generate embeddings for all receipts

### **AI Model Configuration**
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (384 dimensions)
- **Data Extraction**: GPT-4o for receipt processing
- **Validation**: Perplexity AI for data correction
- **RAG**: GPT-4o for question answering

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own receipts
- **Secure Authentication**: Email/password with Supabase Auth
- **Encrypted Storage**: Receipt images stored securely in Supabase Storage
- **API Key Protection**: All sensitive keys stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can manage data collection preferences
- **AI Data Handling**: Receipt data is processed securely and not stored by AI providers
- **Admin Portal Security**: Hardcoded credentials for administrative access (NEW!)
- **Database Function Security**: SECURITY DEFINER functions bypass RLS safely (NEW!)

## 🔔 Push Notifications

To enable push notifications:
- Open the app and visit settings or the onboarding flow to grant notification permissions
- Ensure service worker `src/sw.ts` is registered (handled by Vite PWA config)
- Deploy the `send-push-notification` Edge Function and configure triggers as needed
- Warranty alerts use milestones (90, 30, 7 days) and deduplicate notifications

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Mobile browsers**: Responsive design works on all major mobile browsers
- **PWA Support**: Can be installed as a Progressive Web App
- **Admin Portal**: Optimized for desktop browsers with full responsive support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Camera not working**
   - Ensure HTTPS connection (required for camera access)
   - Check browser permissions for camera access
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **OCR not extracting text**
   - Ensure good lighting when taking photos
   - Keep receipt flat and in focus
   - Try the manual entry option as backup
   - For PDF receipts, ensure they contain extractable text (not just images)

3. **AI validation not working**
   - Check that `VITE_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
   - Verify the API key is correct (starts with `pplx-`)
   - Check browser console for error messages
   - Ensure brand validation returns clean names (not verbose explanations)

4. **Smart search returning no results**
   - Ensure receipts have embeddings generated
   - Check that the smart-search edge function is deployed
   - Verify OpenAI API key is configured

5. **Voice transcription not working** (NEW!)
   - **Microphone Permission**: Grant microphone access when prompted
   - **HTTPS Required**: Voice input only works on secure connections (HTTPS or localhost)
   - **Browser Support**: Ensure your browser supports MediaRecorder API
   - **n8n Webhook**: Verify the webhook endpoint is accessible and configured correctly
   - **Audio Format**: The app automatically handles audio format conversion for compatibility
   - **Network Issues**: Check console for transcription API errors
   - **Recording Issues**: Try shorter recordings (under 30 seconds work best)

6. **Multi-product receipts not grouping**
   - Check that the database migration was applied
   - Verify `receipt_group_id` and `is_group_receipt` columns exist
   - Review the MultiProductReceiptService logs

7. **Admin Portal Issues** (NEW!)
   - **406 "Not Acceptable" errors**: These are handled gracefully by the app
   - **Statistics not loading**: Check that `get_admin_subscription_stats()` function exists
   - **Code generation failing**: Verify `create_subscription_code()` function is available
   - **Codes not displaying**: This is expected due to RLS - codes appear when generated
   - **Login issues**: Verify admin credentials are correct
   - **Database permission errors**: The app handles these with local storage fallbacks

8. **Build errors**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

9. **Database connection issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys in `.env.local`
   - Check if Supabase project is active
   - Ensure migrations are applied

10. **Push notifications not showing**
   - Verify browser permission for notifications is granted
   - Check that `send-push-notification` function is deployed
   - Ensure the service worker `src/sw.ts` is being served and registered
   - Test from a secure origin (HTTPS or localhost)

11. **Warranty Claims Issues** (NEW!)
    - **Claims not submitting**: Check that `VITE_WARRANTY_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly
    - **Webhook timeouts**: n8n webhook may be slow, wait for response
    - **Missing claim statistics**: Ensure `get_user_warranty_claims_stats()` function exists
    - **Claim ID not generating**: Verify `generate_claim_id()` function and trigger are active
    - **Profile picture not loading**: Check Supabase storage permissions and signed URL generation
    - **Dashboard count not updating**: Claims stats refresh automatically, try manual refresh

12. **Google sign-in redirect issues**
    - Confirm `VITE_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` matches your Google OAuth Client ID
    - Verify redirect URIs include `/auth/v1/callback` and your app domain
    - Ensure Google provider is enabled in Supabase
